### Debug snakelike

[Lachlanâ€™s snakemake-econ-R workshop](https://github.com/lachlandeer/snakemake-econ-r) has the following bugs:

1. The following object `purrr` is masked from `package:magrittr`

   ```R
   library(purrr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
   ```

2. `Error in make_option(c("-fp", "--filepath"), type = "character", default = NULL,`

   ```R
   make_option(c("-fp", "--filepath") ...
   ```

3. no package called `rticles`

   ```R
   install.packages("rticles")
   ```

4. Many more bugs...
